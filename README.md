Module Challenge 3 presents the task of creating a random password generator using HTML, CSS, and now JavaScript

# Description

For this week's challenge I have applied all my basic knowledge and understanding of JavaScript to create a functional random name generator.

This was an especially challenging project, as logic is apparently not my strong suit. I worked for a few hours adding to, removing from, rearranging and revising my code, generating different (and undesired) results as I worked with each moving part. Some things nearly worked, and other things did not do anything to help at all, and through this process I was able to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. 

Ultimately I came to a stand-still with the random generation. Since I couldn't find any existing code that we had worked with in class to randomly generate characters, I finally resorted to searching for the answers online. I found the string of code I was looking for and worked it into my code until it finally generated the results I wanted. 

This project helped me practice declaring variables, calling functions, creating a working for-loop. I have ingrained the difference between a string and a number into my brain (this somehow tripped me up the most, and I kept overthinking it). This project also gave me an opportunity to mess with the CSS styling a bit further and create somethign more aesthetically pleasing. I know it wasn't in the acceptance criteria, but as a graphic designer I can't help myself. 

# Usage

Open the webpage using this link: https://hipster-rufus.github.io/animated-bassoon-3. The url should take you to a page that looks like this:
![Screenshot of webpage](./assets/images/animated-bassoon-3.png)
When you click on the "Generate Password" button below, the first prompt should pop up asking you what you want the length of your password to be.
![Prompt1, incorrect](./assets/images/input1-incorrect.png)
However, if you were to enter the same number as in the example or less than that number, this alert will pop up:
![Alert](./assets/images/alert1.png)
When your input meets the code's criteria, it will lead you through a series of questions to gather information:
![Prompt1, correct](./assets/images/input1-correct.png)
![Confirm1](./assets/images/confirm1.png)
![Confirm1](./assets/images/confirm2.png)
![Confirm1](./assets/images/confirm3.png)
![Confirm1](./assets/images/confirm4.png)
And finally, when you've answered all of the prompts, your password is generated below in the box:
![Return1](./assets/images/return1.png)
